# PlayGames
PlayGames is MERN Stack fully functional app. In this app you can register with your email as a Player and Tournament Organiser(Admin).

Players can register in any tournament and they can see the registered tournaments in their profile.

While organisers can post any tournament and organisers can see participating teams details in their dashboard section.

Both Player side and admin side have different front ends but both have the same backend.
